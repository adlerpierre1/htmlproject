            <p>My life started on a cool "Winter" day. I say winter with quotes because I think everyone knows Miami doesn't have winter.
             But nonetheless the day was beautiful. I was born in a litter of 10, 5 brothers and 4 sisters.
              All of us came out with a golden brown coat, and a few of us had black streaks somewhere on our backs.</p>
            <p>  One day while my siblings and I were eat our favorite meal (KFC fried chicken) a few tall strangers came and were
               watching us eat. As they were watching us I noticed one of them point directly at me and said "that one".
                I immediately withdrew under my favorite chair where I knew I'd be safe, or I thought. I was accosted,
                  the tallest one reached under the chair and lifted me up, but to my surprise he was very gentle and I kinda felt safe.
                   Even though this would be the last day I ever saw my siblings again. After we arrived where they were taking me I got
                    this sensation I never got before, it was the smell of chicken, but not just any chicken it was home cooked and
                     so much of it. From that day on I knew I was where I was supposed to be.</p>

              <p>  As I got older I would be able to escape the backyard like a pro, and my master didn't really seem to mind so I kept
              Escaping but never staying out to long. One day I was following my master on one of his explorations of the neighborhood.
               He started walking in this dark forest made entirely of palm trees. I was a little skeptical but he's the boss so I kept
                going, as we got deeper in this palm tree forest we spotted a house in the distance. As soon as we got close enough to
                 the house, 5 rottweilers (my sworn enemy) pop out of nowhere. My first instinct it to protect master but this time I
                  knew I was way outnumbered, so I ran and took cover. From my hiding spot I saw everything, first my master started
                  to run, and faster than I have ever seen him run at that. As he weaved in and out of trees I saw him smack right into
                   a thick branch with his forehead. It didn't even seem to faze him, soon enough he was out of the death forest and was
                    time to make my way home. When I got home I found my master with a big cut on his head, but I noticed he was just
                     concerned with the fact that I was OK. I've had many wonderful experiences in my time alive and I couldn't ask for
                      a better family. I died about 5 years later due to old age, I don't regret a thing.</p>
